Motivation:
1. Object creation logic becomes too convoluted
2. Constructor logic is not descriptive
2.1 Name Mandated by name of containing type
2.2 Can not overload with same set of arguments with same name
2.3 can turn into optional parameter hell
3. Object creation can be outsourced to either some class or some particular function

Why to Use:

Factory Method Pattern allows the sub-classes to choose the type of objects to create. 
It promotes the loose-coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific 
classes into the code.
