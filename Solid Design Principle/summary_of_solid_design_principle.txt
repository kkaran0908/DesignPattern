A class should only have single reason to change
Separation of concerns i.e. a class must handle only single responsibility

2. Open-Closed Principle:

Class should be close for modification but open for extension

3. Interface segregation principle

Don't put too much into an interface but split into separate interfaces

4. Dependency inversion principle

High-Level modules/constructs must not be dependent on low-level modules/constructs
